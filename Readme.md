# Hello stranger!
Hello! My name is Ivan Ribeiro Mello and I am an accountant who graduated by the University of Brasilia (UnB). I've been learning some 'hackery tricks' ('gambiarras' in portuguese) during my professional experiences in Financial Services, Audit, Banks and Fintech industries for the past 10 years.

In my free time, I love to explore new programming languages, listen to music, and attend to cultural events. I've never left a good chilling time with cold beer and friends to the next day.

This is my repo to store all my production, mostly Python scripts, while I am doing my Masters in Accounting at Federal University of Goi√°s (UFG), Brazil. The repo name is a tribute to Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means.
